      <h1>How to Play Minesweeper</h1>
      <p>Minesweeper is a game of logical deduction, where you have a grid board with an unknown number of hidden mines that you must avoid. The entire board starts unrevealed, and you can reveal a square by clicking it (or tapping on mobile). The first square you click will never be a mine, nor will the squares next to it. The board will then automatically reveal any squares adjacent to a square that isn't next to any mines, and squares that are next to any number of mines will show how many they are next to. After your first click you'll end up with something looking like this:</p>
      <p>placeholder for an image of a new board</p>
      <p>Based on this revealed information you should be able to start making deductions about where mines are likely to be. For example, the square highlighted in this image:</p>
      <p>placeholder for an image of above board with one square highlighted</p>
      <p>We know that square is adjacent to one mine, and that all the squares except one have been revealed as non-mines. Therefore, we know that last unrevealed square is a mine and can flag it by right clicking it (or a held down tap on mobile).</p>
      <p>placeholder for an image of above board with one flag</p>
      <p>The flag stops us from clicking it again unless we remove the flag by right clicking the square again. We can also use the flags to reveal squares in another way: by clicking a square that is already revealed. For example, now that the flag is in place we know everything next to the square below the one we used earlier are safe</p>
      <p>placeholder for an image of above board with safe squares highlighted</p>
      <p>So if we left click that square it will reveal all of them</p>
      <p>placeholder for an image of above board with the adjacent squares clicked</p>
      <p>This method assumes your flags are correct, if they aren't not you'll likely lose when you try it so be careful</p>
