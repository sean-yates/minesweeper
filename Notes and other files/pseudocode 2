Ok so I did everything I set out to do in Pseudocode 1 and I have working minesweeper


now we want a list of nice to have features to complete, at which point we will feel comfortable beginning to work on the solvability problem
so here is that list:

1. have board settings be the only thing on the page till the board generates, then go away until you want to generate a new board
2. phone functionality
3. store high scores
