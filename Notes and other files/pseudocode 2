Ok so I did everything I set out to do in Pseudocode 1 and I have working minesweeper


now we want a list of nice to have features to complete, at which point we will feel comfortable beginning to work on the solvability problem
so here is that list:

1. try and get the classic flag and mine icons
2. add screenshots to howToPlay
3. make howToPlay pretty
4. make win and lose prettier, maybe there are more visually appealing alerts?
5. have board settings be the only thing on the page till the board generates, then go away until you want to generate a new board
6. make sure github host works and add link to readme
7. phone functionality
8. store high scores
