Ok so I did everything I set out to do in Pseudocode 1 and I have working minesweeper


now we want a list of nice to have features to complete, at which point we will feel comfortable beginning to work on the solvability problem
so here is that list:

1. host through github
2. fill out readme page
3. add how to play page 
4. check assignemnt for other requirements
5. make win and lose prettier, maybe there are more visually appealing alerts?
6. have board settings be the only thing on the page till the board generates, then go away until you want to generate a new board
7. add background and improve some of the colors?
8. try and get the classic flag and mine icons
