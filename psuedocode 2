Ok so I did everything I set out to do in Pseudocode 1 and I have working minesweeper


now we want a list of nice to have features to complete, at which point we will feel comfortable beginning to work on the solvability problem
so here is that list:

1. Make win and lose conditions freeze the board and send a message
2. Show remaining mine count
3. various todos in comments
4. fill out readme page
5. add how to play page 
6. check assignemnt for other requirements
7. figure out how to host online?
8. have options for the board be the only thing on the page till the board generates, then go away until you want to generate a new board
