Ok so I did everything I set out to do in Pseudocode 1 and I have working minesweeper


now we want a list of nice to have features to complete, at which point we will feel comfortable beginning to work on the solvability problem
so here is that list:

1. fields where you can enter desired height / width / mine count
2. buttons that set these values to some default combinations (small, medium, large)
3. Reset button, returns the board to a base state using values from fields on step 1
    a. should stop and throw an error if you request too many mines (more than total size - 9)
    b. max height and width as well?
4. Make mines and flags use the classic icons
5. Make win and lose conditions freeze the board and send a message
6. fill out readme page
7. check assignemnt for other requirements
