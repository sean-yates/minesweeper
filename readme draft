User Stories:

Game should start with a blank 9 x 9 grid with no squares revealed and 10 randomly hidden mines

left clicking any square should reveal it, revealing a mine should end the game

the first square revealed should never be a mine, or have a mine within 2 squares

Squares that donâ€™t have a mine but are adjacent to any number of mines should show the number of mines they are adjacent to when revealed

right clicking a square should put a flag on it, indicating the user believes it has a mine

game should show how many mines remain unflagged

game should should show how much time has passed since starting the puzzle, pausing when a mine is clicked or the game is won

correctly flagging all mines and revealing all other squares wins the game
